# 🌐 Infrared Barrier Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the design files for an **Infrared Barrier system** that detects interruptions in an infrared beam and processes them for counting or triggering events.  
The project was developed for educational purposes, focusing on a compact and adaptable design.  

## ✨ Features  
* Detects objects passing through an infrared beam.  
* Counts and displays events in real time.  
* Visual and/or audible indicators for detections.  
* Adjustable timing and sensitivity.  
* PCB layout and schematic ready for fabrication.  

## 📂 Repository Contents  
* **barriere_IR.sch** – Schematic file (circuit design).  
* **barriere_IR.brd** – PCB layout file (board design).  
* **schéma_de_routage.pdf** – Routing diagram.  
* **schéma_d'implantation.pdf** – Component placement diagram.  
* **TYPON.pdf** – PCB mask for manufacturing or DIY etching.  
* **barriere_IR.s## / barriere_IR.s#1** – Backup schematic versions.  

## 🛠 Usage  
1. **Open & Edit** → Use *Autodesk Eagle* to view or modify the schematic and PCB files.  
2. **Fabricate PCB** → Generate Gerber files or use the provided PDF mask for DIY etching.  
3. **Assemble** → Follow the placement diagram for soldering components.  
4. **Test & Calibrate** → Power the system, test beam interruption detection, and adjust sensitivity if needed.
